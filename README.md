# Project Brief  

The most prominent feature of the Internet is the high efficiency and low cost of information processing. Anyone can easily publish, transmit and access various information through the Internet without any restriction of time and place. How to efficiently determine the authenticity and reliability of the interactive information, as well as ensure the immutability of electronic documents, has always been a huge challenge to the Internet.

Dimension-D adopts the blockchain technology to implement the notary system and store the data on-chain. It transforms the arbitrary length of input data into a fixed-length output through the hash algorithm and then performs a length verification algorithm from the original key. Dimension-D eliminates the possibility of data and documents being forged and altered from the source end, and it uses a distributed storage system to process data on-chain which provides easy access.

- Hash Record: Any digital data, such as electronic data, electronic files, contracts, pictures, or works, generates a unique and fixed size of data after hashing, which is called hash values, also known as the digital fingerprint of the data. The content of the original data canâ€™t be figured out by knowing hash values. If there's any change with the original data, a new and unpredictable hash value will be regenerated.

- E-Signature: By using asymmetric encryption technology to encrypt the data with a private key signature, the sender sends the data to the blockchain network. The proof of the data source is undeniable, and the transmission process is immutable. 

- Block Production: The data and certificate that sent to the blockchain network will be packaged into blocks after a consensus is reached, and then synchronized with every node in the network for distributed storage. 

- Certificate Issuance: When a user needs to prove his stored data, he can contact the corresponding credibility agency to issue a certificate.

Dimension-D is suitable for business that requires data verification, such as notary public, insurance, trust, charity, and others.
